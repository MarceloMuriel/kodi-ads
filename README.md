Play back videos and ads on Kodi

This is a Kodi service add-on intended for *Raspberry-Pi* and alike (Linux using omxplayer for audio) and *Mac OS X* (afplay for audio). 

It plays a list of videos from a directory in a loop with no audio (mute). It looks for a different directory for audio files, 
useful to adapt to the place (e.g. a restaurant, a waiting room). Then, it allows defining a series of ads (videos and/or images) 
that will be displayed at specified times and frequencies (e.g. every 15 min.). 

The goal of this project was to be displayed on a TV in a restaurant (connected to a raspberry pi with Kodi), so that customers could 
watch videos with a background music. Also letting the restaurant to display its announcements (e.g. menu as an image) 
and publicity (short videos).
